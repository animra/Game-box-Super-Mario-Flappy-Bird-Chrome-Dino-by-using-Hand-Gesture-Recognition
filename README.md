# Game box (Super Mario, Flappy Bird, and Chrome Dino) by using Hand Gesture Recognition!

Contributed to the group project where we developed a standalone desktop application that will feature some of the popular classic games like Flappy Bird, Super Mario & Chrome Dino. The objective is to make the games more engaging and stylish for people of all ages by enhancing their interactivity with the games themselves and user-friendliness. In addition, hand gestures will be integrated into the games so that players can use their hands through the webcam to play the games, overall making a more immersive gaming experience.
